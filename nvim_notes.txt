Marks
'a - 'z  - lowercase marks, valid within one file
'A - 'Z  - uppercase marks, also called file marks, valid between files
Lowercase marks can be used in combination with operators.  For example: "d't" deletes the lines from the cursor position to mark 't'. 
m{a-zA-Z}  - Set mark {a-zA-Z} at cursor position
'{a-z}  - Move to line containing mark {a-z}
`{a-z}  - Move to position where mark {a-z} was set

'.  - Move to last edited line
`.  - Move to last edited position
'[  - Move to start of last change
']  - Move to end of last change
''  - Move to position before last jump
``  - Move to position before last jump
'^  - Move to position where last insert started

Searching

<space> /  - Grep in root dir
<leader> sw  - Grep word under cursor (root dir)

Visual mode: <leader> sW  - Search for current selection (cwd)
Find in files:
  1) <leader> sG  - Open live_grep (telescope)
  2) Start typing
  3) Realize that you need to scope to directory
  4) <Ctrl-f>
  5) Select directory
  6) Get returned to live_grep, scoped to the directory you selected and with your search args still populated
Find and Replace One Occurrence at a Time:
  1) Execute a regular search with /
  2) Use the keystroke cgn on the first result to replace it.
  3) Type n or N to go to the next result.
  4) Use . to replace the occurrence with the same replacement, or go to the next result if you want to keep it.
Search and replace with confirmation

Flash
S  - Flash Treesitter (normal mode). All parents of the Treesitter node under your cursor are highlighted with a label for quick selection of a specific Treesitter node. Use ; and , to increase/decrease the selection.
f{char} or F{char}  - Jump forward or backward to the [count]'th occurrence of {char} in the current line. The cursor is placed on {char} inclusive. Repeat motion with f, or undo motion with F. Can also use ; and ,
t{char} or T{char}  - Same as f{char} or F{char}, except the cursor is placed on {char} exclusive.
[operator]R  - Treesitter search. For example, yR will enter a flash search and then yank the selected treesitter node. dR would delete the selected node.
[operator]r  - Opens flash in remote mode. This is similar to R, but will return you to the original window/position.
               For example, yr will start yanking and open flash. Select a label to set the cursor position. Perform a motion, like iw or start flash Treesitter with S.
               The yank will be performed and the cursor will be returned to the original position.
